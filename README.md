# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"></h2> 

You can call me Jo√£o Felipe, I was born in Florian√≥polis, the Magic Island, in Santa Catarina, Brazil.

I'm majoring in Public Administratio at UDESC and one of my passions is entrepreneurship, mainly connected with subjects such as: innovation and technology, sport and entertainment.

Beyond the graduation, I'm studying Data Science and looking to integrate my areas of interest to this area.

Actually I'm intern at [Funda√ß√£o CERTI](https://www.certi.org.br/), supporting the development of projects related to ecosystems and innovation environments around Brazil. 

During the time I participated in [ESAG's Atl√©tica](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atleticaesag/), as a project advisor, one of my greatest lessons was to understand that different experiences have an impact lives. Since then I have been looking to live and provide incredible experiences in my projects, whether professional or personal.

At the beginning of the journey to becoming a data scientist.
